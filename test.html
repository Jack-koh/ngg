                <span class="regular">Do you have bus parking?</span><br />
                We do not have dedicated bus parking. However, you are welcome to pull in front of our main entrance
                located at 1145 17th Street NW just south of M Street to unload and load your bus.<br /><br />

                <span class="regular">Where can I park a bus?</span><br />
                The District Department of Transportation has a wonderful website that can help guide you through your
                trip to the museum, including parking. Learn more on their website at
                http://ddot.dc.gov/service/tour-bus-parking; they can also be reached by phone at 202.671.0682. There is
                paid parking directly across the street for personal vehicles and the closest dedicated bus parking is
                on the southbound side of 15th Street between E Street NW and Constitution Avenue NW.<br /><br />

                <span class="regular">Can I schedule a 3-D film screening for my group?</span><br />
                Yes, we can schedule screenings of 3-D films for groups of 25 people or more. The fee is $5 per person
                plus a $50 reservation fee and based on availability. We typically require two weeks advance notice to
                schedule a screening.<br /><br />

                <span class="regular">How far in advance do I need to make a reservation?</span><br />
                Ideally, we would like to have two weeks notice before your group’s arrival. We understand that
                attendance may change and we encourage you to make reservations with a conservative guest count. We can
                make adjustments closer to your visit, if necessary.<br /><br />

                <span class="regular">Is there space for my students to have lunch?</span><br />
                The National Geographic Museum does not have space for groups to have lunch.<br /><br />

                <span class="regular">What’s the largest group I can bring?</span><br />
                The museum can accommodate groups as large as 150 and can typically keep your visit under two hours. We
                often have the group split into smaller, more manageable numbers to make your time here more enjoyable.
                If you have an exceptionally large group it may take longer to get everyone through the exhibitions.<br /><br />

                <span class="regular">Can my group reserve a guided tour?</span><br />
                Yes, guided tours are $50 per tour and take approximately 45 minutes. We can accommodate up to 25 people
                per tour. If you have a larger group we can do multiple tours, each tour costing $50. This can increase
                the amount of time it takes to visit the museum.
