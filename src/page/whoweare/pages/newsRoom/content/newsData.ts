        The water is 30 degrees C. The sea is clear and calm and beneath the vessel a garden of colorful coral awaits. Why not go diving?  We are on a reef at Kalapuan Island in the Semporna group of Malaysian Borneo, not our usual dive destination. This island is the home of our staff, the…

        Por John Polisar A principios del 2017, participé en un estudio ecológico dirigido por Conservation International para evaluar los atributos biológicos del sitio arqueológico en Honduras conocido como Ciudad Blanca, o la Ciudad Perdida del Dios Mono. El área era tan remota que nos transportaron en helicóptero. Caminamos a través de ríos y cumbres montañosas…

Stewart tugboat and articulated barge surged south through the vast, turbulent waters modernly known as Seaforth Channel in the heart of Canada’s Great Bear Rainforest, in Heiltsuk First Nation territories.

        This week we are allowed a unique insight into the lives of birds that hunt. When we think of birds hunting, we typically picture a raptor with ferocious talons and a sharp beak to tear apart prey. But in fact many birds will hunt opportunistically.

        We are now at a point in the course of human history where there are only a handful of places on Earth that are not severely altered by the footprint of large-scale industrial activities.
