          In the dark, early hours of October 13th, 2016, the Nathan E. Stewart tugboat and articulated barge surged south through the vast, turbulent waters modernly known as Seaforth Channel in the heart of Canada’s Great Bear Rainforest, in Heiltsuk First Nation territories. The American-based tug (also referred to as the “NES”) was returning to Vancouver Harbor after delivering nearly 8 million liters of jet fuel and gasoline to Ketchikan, Alaska.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dawn on October 13th revealed the NES run aground on the reefs of Athlone Island, its crew being rescued off the sinking ship by the Canadian Coast Guard. Its hull was hemorrhaging diesel fuel and synthetic lubricants that would eventually result in the devastating spill of over 110,000 liters of contaminants into the Pacific ecosystem. On November 14th, 32 days after its grounding, the disfigured remains of the NES were finally lifted from the seafloor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Athlone Island, where the tug and its barge ran aground, is a millennia-old harvesting site stewarded and managed by the Heiltsuk First Nation of Bella Bella, British Columbia, whose unceded territory witnessed the disastrous end of the NES that dark morning in October. The Heiltsuk Nation has fostered complex and sustainable relationships with their traditional lands and waters for at least a documented 14,000 years, and likely longer. The NES spill site, known locally as Gale Pass (at and around the ancient village of Q’vúqvai), was and remains a focal and biodiverse community harvesting ground. The impacts of the diesel spill on the Heiltsuk cannot be overstated; not only do the fishing grounds represent an abundance of protein that supports physical subsistence, but also the area provides a powerful environment to practice traditional harvesting, knowledge transmission, and support Heiltsuk cultural revitalization efforts despite more than two centuries of oppressive colonization.

          This week we are allowed a unique insight into the lives of birds that hunt. When we think of birds hunting, we typically picture a raptor with ferocious talons and a sharp beak to tear apart prey. But in fact many birds will hunt opportunistically. In this week’s Top 25 we feature a wide range of birds that have defeated the odds and have made a spectacular catch! We have bee-eaters, seabirds, hornbills, waders and, of course, the raptors. Thank you to everyone who contributed this week, your pictures bring the world of these birds to life for all of us
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to build a global community around the freedom and beauty of birds in the wild as ambassadors for the natural ecosystems that they depend upon. They are the music, decoration, and character of every terrestrial habitat on the planet and have been around since the dinosaurs. They are the witnesses and ambassadors of the awesome power of nature. The wide availability of good, cheap optics has opened their world to us for the last few decades. Amazing, affordable DSLR cameras with long lenses are delivering brilliant digital bird imagery to online communities.

        <p>
          We are now at a point in the course of human history where there are only a handful of places on Earth that are not severely altered by the footprint of large-scale industrial activities. Those within parts of the Earth where trees are dominant are termed “intact” or “primary” forests. A few weeks ago I joined more than a hundred other scientists and conservationists for a three-day conference at Oxford University in England to discuss the issues, needs, similarities, and differences related to the science and conservation of the world’s forest landscapes that are considered intact.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conference, Intact Forests in the 21st Century, included presentations on the issues of how best to map and identify intact forest landscapes, methods for inventory and identification of conservation values of intact forests, ways of communicating about the importance of intact forests to the public and policy makers, elucidation of the major threats and stressors that are eliminating or degrading intact forests, and strategies for achieving conservation of these forest landscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Five regions of the globe have very large forested landscapes that contain large tracts of intact or primary forest: the Boreal Forest of Canada and Alaska, the Boreal Forest of Russia and Scandinavia, the Amazon Forest of South America, the Congo Basin of Africa, and the forests of Papua New Guinea and Malayasia. While this “Family of Five” forest areas are called by some the “Last Five,” it is important to point out that there are other areas of forest around the globe, some of which, while perhaps smaller at the global scale, are intact and others which are recovering from past human impacts and that need conservation attention as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          But certainly the “Family of Five” was a major focus of presentations at the conference and the range of research and conservation initiatives that are underway in these regions is impressive. At the same time, it was clear from all presentations that there continues to be rapid loss of these last intact forest landscapes on the planet, with consequent loss of animal and plant species as well as degradation of the ability of forests to provide clean air and water, and to store away carbon pollution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Boreal Forest region of Canada and Alaska was highlighted for its global significance containing as it does, at least a quarter of the world’s last large intact forest landscapes that have in storage over 200 billion tons of carbon and that support billions of migratory birds and a host of mammals, fish, insects, and plants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also highlighted was the fact that the Boreal Forest of Canada and Alaska is the ancestral homeland of hundreds of Indigenous communities whose governments are increasingly taking the lead in achieving balanced protection and stewardship of their lands and waters, and the animals and plants found there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the major problems in the region were also given attention including the plight of rapidly declining Boreal Woodland Caribou populations in Canada and the opportunity for increasing protections as governments strive to achieve by 2020 the conservation commitments embodied in the Aichi Biodiversity Treaty. The long-term impacts to the Boreal Forest of the very large footprint of industrial forestry as well as from mining, oil, and gas; large-scale hydro, and other global industries was demonstrated as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the conference reached its conclusion, delegates came together to show a global voice and vision for the world’s remaining intact forests and their conservation through an Intact Forest Declaration that attendees and others will be signing and spotlighting in coming months. By sharing our knowledge, ideas and understanding among those working for conservation across all the world’s Intact Forest landscapes, we hope we can increase the collective conservation gains for all of the Family of the Five and beyond.

        <p>
          From July 16-21, a record number of scientists and other experts from around the world gathered in Geneva at a scientific and technical committee meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to debate the best way to protect the world’s endangered species.
        </p>
        <p>
          And fittingly, in this most sharky of weeks, that included global shark conservation experts. I attended as part of the delegation of WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) to focus on issues regarding sharks and rays. CITES member governments have been working to secure a future for species threatened by trade since the Convention entered into force in 1975. In the last several years, it has finally been placing an increasing focus on saving the world’s sharks and rays. CITES member governments meet every 2-3 years to decide which species should be protected under the treaty—either regulating or prohibiting their trade (so-called “Appendices”). With an unstainable, largely unregulated trade in fins (and increasingly shark meat) driving global declines of sharks and rays, in 2013 CITES took a landmark step in protection species—such as hammerhead sharks and manta rays—that were being driven to the brink of extinction by the international demand for their fins (and for mantas, their gill plates). Today, the real work is underway, for governments to implement these listings, and ensure that hammerhead sharks, mantas, devil rays, and many other species, do not disappear due to rampant, unsustainable international trade.
        </p>
        <p>
          WCS is at the forefront of that effort, both at these high-level scientific meetings at high-level international conferences such as the CITES Conference of the Parties, at the UN level, and on the ground globally, where our programs around the world work closely with Governments to put in place the monitoring, enforcement and management measures that these listings mandate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last week in Geneva, the gathered experts discussed new and innovative ways of identifying shark and ray products that are being traded illegally—using visual and genetic enforcement tools. They also reviewed progress to date, and reminded countries of the need for domestic action to properly manage shark catch and trade
        </p>
        <p>
          Progress is slow, but crucial. For many countries, the CITES listings of sharks and rays provided the first driver to manage trade and the fisheries that underpin them, building on the strong record of enforcement action that the CITES Convention carries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tens of millions of sharks and rays are in international trade every year for the food trade, and CITES is trying to do its part to ensure they have a future. Sharks won’t be effectively protected or sustainably managed overnight, but CITES shark and ray listings, and the real change their careful implementation is bringing, provide a ray of hope that we can act before these ancient predators vanish forever.

          The water is 30 degrees C. The sea is clear and calm and beneath the vessel a garden of colorful coral awaits. Why not go diving? We are on a reef at Kalapuan Island in the Semporna group of Malaysian Borneo, not our usual dive destination. This island is the home of our staff, the local dive masters and captains at the Tropical Reef and Conservation Centre (TRACC) lab on Pom Pom Island where we have been working for five summers, helping to restore fish bombed corals, reintroducing fish including sharks, and generate a new protected reef for divers to enjoy in a region that has been highly disturbed by human impact. Instead of diving, This time, I am staying topside and using the Trident ROV as part of our National Geographic Open Explorer project to survey benthic habitat, and in this case, disease and invasive Crown of Thorn Starfish (COTS).
        </p>
        <p>
          Kalapuan is a largely undeveloped low island, with an old coconut farm, a new high-end resort directed at Chinese tourists, and nearly 800 local people known as the Bajau. These people are the last of the Sea Gypsies. Some live in water houses, others still on the boats they were born on. The village is growing, and the people rely on fish, and most work at fishing to survive. Like much of this region of the world, the population is stretching beyond the limits of sustainable use of the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overfishing the reef, and nutrient loads from the village are impacting the adjacent reef system, yet sections of corals still remain in a healthy state. Recently, an outbreak of the predatory starfish the Crown of Thorns (Ancantaster placii) have proliferated at the island Pulau Gaya in the Tun Sakaran Marine Protected Park just 6 Km east of the TRACC home on Pom Pom, and about the same distance north of Kalapuan. Last year a COTS increase was observed on the reef at the Park, an area of high human habitation and impact. Some of the most effective predators on the starfish include titan triggerfish (Balistoides viridescens), and the Maori wrasse (Cheilinus undulates) and Triton snails (Charonia tritonis). These species have been largely overfished, removing predatory regulation.

          A principios del 2017, participé en un estudio ecológico dirigido por Conservation International para evaluar los atributos biológicos del sitio arqueológico en Honduras conocido como Ciudad Blanca, o la Ciudad Perdida del Dios Mono. El área era tan remota que nos transportaron en helicóptero. Caminamos a través de ríos y cumbres montañosas y, de este modo, obtuvimos la mayor cantidad de información posible, luego dejamos las cámaras trampa instaladas en el área para que las retiraran en helicóptero seis meses después.
        </p>
        <p>
          Le dije al equipo que había visto rastros de pecaríes de labios blancos debajo del denso camino del sotobosque río abajo. Sabiendo que este animal parecido a un cerdo, diseminado ampliamente en el pasado, actualmente se ha erradicado en un 87 por ciento de su área de distribución original en América Central, el equipo expresó dudas sobre que estuvieran allí. Seis meses después, las imágenes de las cámaras trampa mostraban manadas marchando a través de arroyos y senderos, casi en todas partes.

          Tales avistamientos en Mesoamérica son bastante poco frecuentes. La aparición de este animal en este sitio, que no había sido visitado por seres humanos durante 500 años, señala a Ciudad Blanca como una joya. Pero no permanecerá así sin esfuerzos previsores de conservación a gran escala.

          As the amount of single-use plastic in the world’s oceans continues to grow, National Geographic is announcing a new, global commitment to tackle this pressing problem. Today, National Geographic is launching Planet or Plastic?, a multiyear initiative aimed at raising awareness of this challenge and reducing the amount of single-use plastic that enters in the world’s oceans. Doing so will not only benefit the thousands to potentially millions of marine animals that become entangled in, suffocated by, or ingest plastic each year, but will also contribute to the overall health of the planet’s marine ecosystems and all who rely upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a global brand with a rich history of scientific discovery and exploration, National Geographic is uniquely positioned to tackle this crisis in a way that only National Geographic can — through storytelling and science. The Planet or Plastic? initiative will leverage the power of National Geographic’s media portfolio around the world and the expertise of National Geographic’s explorers and scientists who are witnessing firsthand the devastating impacts of this crisis. This organization-wide effort will include a major research and scientific initiative; a consumer education and engagement campaign; updated internal corporate sustainability commitments; and innovative partnerships with like-minded corporations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today’s launch is tied to the release of the June issue of National Geographic magazine, which takes an in-depth look at the role single-use plastic plays in our society and the impact they are having on our environment. Starting with this issue, National Geographic announced that it will begin wrapping the U.S., U.K. and India subscriber editions of the magazine in paper instead of plastic, with the goal of wrapping all global editions in paper by the end of 2019. The June issue is available online at natgeo.com/planetorplastic on May 16 and on print newsstands on May 29.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each year, 9 million tons of plastic waste ends up in the ocean. Some estimates suggest this plastic could remain in marine environments for 450 years or longer, and the problem is only getting worse. Addressing a challenge of this magnitude requires an unprecedented approach. In concert with the release of the June magazine, the Planet or Plastic? initiative will also kick off with the following:

          To help celebrate World Oceans Day on June 8th, the National Geographic Society announced the winners of the Marine Protection Prize. The winners include Paul Ferber of Marine Conservation Cambodia, Badr Idrissi of ATLAN Space and Melissa Garren of Pelagic Data Systems. Each winner will be awarded $150,000 to implement their plans.

          Overfishing and illegal fishing severely impact the ecosystem and the communities that rely on those environments. The innovations from the three winning teams have the potential to greatly <span>increase sustainable fishing in coastal systems.</span> These talented individuals will test and improve their ideas to push their innovations to the next level and help create more sustainable fishing practices in communities throughout the world.

          Overfishing and illegal fishing threaten the planet’s oceans, food security and the livelihood of island nations and coastal communities. The purpose of the Marine Protection Prize is to attract a range of solutions that offer low-cost and easy-to-maintain technologies and that are relevant to the needs of local stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          From using artificial intelligence to monitoring and evaluating illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing, the three winning teams are pioneering new approaches to protect and sustain fisheries in coastal communities.

          For example, Marine Conservation Cambodia, led by Paul Ferber, created a project which counters destructive and illegal fishing practices in Kep province, Cambodia by deploying anti-trawling structures and delimiting boundaries of a marine fisheries management area.

          As much as 54 percent of the high seas fishing industry would be unprofitable at its current scale without large government subsidies, according to a new study by researchers from the National Geographic Society; the University of California, Santa Barbara; Global Fishing Watch; the Sea Around Us project at the University of British Columbia; and the University of Western Australia. The research, published today in the open-access journal Science Advances, found that the global cost of fishing in the high seas ranged between $6.2 billion and $8 billion USD in 2014. Profits from this activity range between a loss of $364 million and a profit of $1.4 billion USD.

          The high seas — marine waters beyond national jurisdiction — cover 64 percent of the ocean’s surface and are dominated by a small number of fishing countries, which reap most of the benefits of fishing this internationally shared area. While the environmental impacts of fishing on the high seas are well studied, a high level of secrecy around distant-water fishing had previously precluded reliable estimates of the economic costs and benefits of high seas fishing. However, newly compiled satellite data and machine learning have revealed a far more accurate picture of fishing effort across the globe at the level of individual vessels.

          The reason most fleets continue to operate in the high seas is that they receive government subsidies.

          Using Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) and Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS), the researchers were able to track the individual behavior, fishing activity and other characteristics of 3,620 vessels in near-real time. Combining this information with the global catch data from the University of British Columbia’s Sea Around Us project, the team was then able to determine how much effort the vessels expended, how large their catch was, and how much profit the catch generated.
