      Carlton Ward Jr. is a conservation photographer focused on wild Florida. He founded the Florida Wildlife Corridor project in 2010 and has since trekked 2,000 miles during two National Geographic supported expeditions to advocate for the corridor’s protection. The most recent Florida Wildlife Corridor Expedition is the subject of the new film, The Forgotten Coast, featured at the Environmental Film Festival in Washington, D.C. and broadcast nationally on PBS in 2016.<br/><br/>
      An eighth-generation Floridian, Ward has developed strong connections with conservation organizations, researchers, and landowners. His family owns a ranch in the Peace River Valley that provides habitat for Florida panthers and he has several cousins who are full-time cowboys in the Greater Everglades. He is now working as an ambassador for the recovery of the Florida panther, a plan that calls for conservation of hundreds of thousands of acres of ranchlands and forests and across Florida.<br/><br/>
      Ward is a founding fellow of the International League of Conservation Photographers (iLCP). He earned a master’s degree in Ecology and wrote Conservation Photography, the first thesis on the emerging field. For his first book, The Edge of Africa, Ward worked for the Smithsonian Institution documenting little known biological diversity in the tropical rain forests of Gabon. Resulting photographs were exhibited at a United Nations reception in New York. His 2009 book, Florida Cowboys, won a medal in the Florida Book Awards, and Ward was featured in Popular Photography Magazine for working to save vanishing America. In 2015, Ward was given the Conservation Leadership Award from the Fish & Wildlife Foundation of Florida and named the Rolex Artist-in-Residence with the Explorers Club.<br/><br/>
      Ward’s photographs are exhibited widely and have been published in magazines including Audubon, Smithsonian, Geo, Africa Geographic, Nature Conservancy, and National Geographic.

      Jónína Herdís Ólafsdóttir is a biologist. Born in Iceland, she grew up at the doorstep of a natural paradise. She has a special fascination for outdoor sports that take her to pristine and remote nature. Early on she learned to scuba dive to be able to visit the underwater world of her home country. Her diving interest has taken her worldwide since then, although most of her dives have been in the cold groundwater rift-fissures of Iceland where she used to guide and teach other divers. The cavernous fissures pushed her to seek training and experience in cave-diving to explore them safely. Her exploits also affirmed her passion for underwater ecosystems, and in 2013, with the support of National Geographic, she and her team were the first to document the biodiversity in the groundwater fissures of Iceland.<br/><br/>
      Today Nína works as a biologist for the Marine and Freshwater Institute in Iceland. She has spent the past few years studying groundwater and stream ecosystems. She is currently in the process of relocating to Snæfellsnes peninsula where she will embark upon new projects focusing on the marine environment around Iceland.

      Jenny Owen is a conservation photographer, cave diver, and educator. Her love for the ocean growing up inspired her to study marine biology at Brown University and later to work as a biologist at the U.S. Geological Survey. Her work as a photographer is informed by her scientific background, and she uses her imagery to give a voice to science and conservation. She specializes in cave diving, underwater photography, and 360 underwater imagery, and currently finishing the last few months of her PhD at the University of Florida (graduating May 2018).<br/><br/>
      Her graduate work has focused on freshwater, specifically building a new water ethic and reconnecting the next generation of Floridians to the aquifer beneath their feet. She developed and implemented an environmental education program called Walking on Water that immerses elementary school students in the springs, cameras in hand, and teaches them about the aquifer via the first 360-virtual tour of the Floridan Aquifer .<br/><br/>
      Her interdisciplinary research blends science, communication, and education and seeks to understand how we can most effectively use conservation photography as a tool in both communications and environmental education. She is a TEDxJacksonville alumna and has exhibited throughout Florida and at the Royal Geographical Society in London. You can find her photographs and links to published work on her website and on Instagram @jmadler.<br/><br/>

      Constance Adams believes that science fiction is the history of the future. A space architect known for her projects supporting human exploration of space and the solar system, Adams’ work focuses on the holistic optimization of integrated structures, both technical and human. She has designed crew systems for NASA’s Lunar-Mars missions, including TransHab and BIO-Plex projects as well as such orbital missions as CRV and ISS, and on commercial ventures such as the Virgin Galactic terminal at Spaceport America.<br/><br/>
      To establish a scientific basis for this work, Adams pioneered the field of “sociokinetic” research, which seeks to quantify the interactions of individuals with their built environment and with one another. She applies the results of this research to her work in exploration architecture, adapting design principles of metabolism, biomimicry and systems engineering—a practice she calls “mothership engineering”—to achieve solutions that are efficient, robust, adaptable and useful. A product that successfully achieves all four of these goals, Adams believes, innately expresses an aesthetic that is consistent with the forms that have evolved on our collective “mothership”, the Earth.<br/><br/>
      In the course of her practice, Adams has designed several patented and “space certified” innovations, including the first LED-based luminaire, a ground-breaking hybrid system for deployable structures, and a multi-spectrum radiation shield.<br/><br/>
      Adams holds a degree in Social Studies from Harvard and a Master’s of Architecture from Yale, and has practiced as an architect and urban planner in Japan, Berlin, and the United States.

      After working as a camp manager and wilderness guide in the Okavango Delta, Steve went on to complete his Ph.D. field work on the little-known Meyer's parrot. This work led to his position as a Centre of Excellence Postdoctoral Fellow at the Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology as well as the founding of the Wild Bird Trust, where Steve continues to serve as the scientific director. In this capacity, Steve initiated the Cape Parrot Project, which aims to stimulate positive change for the species through high-quality research and community-based conservation action. His work also contributed to the selection of the Okavango Delta as a World Heritage site in 2014 and has attracted international attention to the illegal pet trade of African grey parrot.<br/><br/>
      In 2013, Steve was selected as a National Geographic Emerging Explorer and as a TED Fellow in 2014. In 2015, as a National Geographic Fellow and TED Senior Fellow, he launched the Okavango Wilderness Project, a multi-year effort aimed at exploring and protecting the little known wilderness of the Angolan highlands that provides over 95 percent of the water that sustains the Okavango Delta and the biodiversity of the greater Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. In 2016, the National Geographic Society signed a $10 million commitment to fund what is now called the National Geographic Okavango Wilderness Project.<br/><br/>

      Brian Skerry is a photojournalist specializing in marine wildlife and underwater environments. Since 1998 he has been a contributing photographer for National Geographic magazine, covering a wide range of subjects and stories.<br/><br/>
      An award-winning photographer, Skerry is praised worldwide for his aesthetic sense, as well as for his journalistic drive for relevance. His uniquely creative images tell stories that not only celebrate the mystery and beauty of the sea but also help to bring attention to the large number of issues that endanger our ocean and its inhabitants.<br/><br/>
      His nearly year-round assignment schedule frequently brings him to extremely contrasting environments, from tropical coral reefs to polar ice. While on assignment, he has lived on the bottom of the sea, spent months aboard fishing boats, and traveled in everything from snowmobiles to canoes to the Goodyear Blimp to get the picture. He has spent more than 10,000 hours underwater over the past 30 years.<br/><br/>
      Skerry has covered a wide range of stories for National Geographic, from the harp seal's struggle to survive in frozen waters to the alarming decrease in the world's fisheries, both of which were cover stories. Other features have focused on subjects such as the planet's last remaining pristine coral reefs, the plight of the right whale, bluefin tuna, marine reserves, sea turtles, and squid. His next feature to appear in the magazine will focus on dolphin cognition, and he is currently at work on four new stories about sharks. His latest monograph, Ocean Soul, has received worldwide acclaim.<br/><br/>
      Skerry frequently lectures on photography and conservation issues, having presented at venues such as TED Talks, the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., the Royal Geographical Society in London, and the Sydney Opera House in Australia. He is also the explorer-in-residence at the New England Aquarium in Boston, a marine fellow with Conservation International, and a member of the World Wildlife Fund's National Council.<br/><br/>
      In 2010 National Geographic magazine named one of Skerry's images among their “50 Greatest Photographs of All Time”. He has had recent exhibits at Visa Pour l'Image in Perpignan, France, as well as in cities such as Geneva, Barcelona, Lisbon, and Shanghai. In 2012 he was honored with the Peter Benchley Award for excellence in media. An exhibit of his work is currently open at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.

      "Albert Lin is very literally a high-tech explorer, having become part-man, part-machine due to the recent addition of a high-tech prosthetic leg. Exploring what he calls the “human frontier”, he has continued to press into the most remote and physically engaging parts of the world to take a technologist’s approach to uncover some of humanity’s most charismatic stories and explore the frontiers of the human experience. He began his career with the Valley of the Khans Project, a technology-enabled search for the tomb of Genghis Khan. Tools such as satellite imagery, crowdsourcing engines, machine learning, drones, and ground-penetrating radar permitted Lin to search for archaeological sites through a vast area while respecting traditional beliefs of indigenous people that called for non-invasive investigations.<br/><br/>
      He has since applied similar approaches to survey the First Emperor’s tomb in China and most recently the Mayan temples of Northern Guatemala. He is responsible for National Geographic’s first crowdsourcing effort to survey satellite imagery in archaeology, which he turned into the platform Tomnod (meaning “big eye” in Mongolian), which has been used by millions on projects ranging from search and rescue to humanitarian and environmental monitoring. Inspired by the idea that science could be democratized through our connectivity, he later co-founded the education company Planet3 Inc. to combine video game design with crowdsourcing to break down the walls of the classroom.

      Something the size of a postage stamp, costing just a penny a piece, could be a medical breakthrough that will save millions of lives. According to Hayat Sindi, when this tiny piece of paper enters an impoverished African village, the power of an entire diagnostic lab has arrived.<br/><br/>
      “My mission is to find simple, inexpensive ways to monitor health that are specifically designed for remote places and harsh conditions,” Sindi notes. She believes technology pioneered by a team at Harvard University will make it possible, and she co-founded the nonprofit Diagnostics For All to produce and distribute the innovation.<br/><br/>
      The low-tech diagnostic tool detects disease by analyzing bodily fluids. The device is produced by etching micro-channels and wells onto a small square of paper and pre-filling the wells with chemicals. To perform a test, a drop of saliva, urine, or blood is placed on the paper. The fluid travels through the channels and a chemical reaction occurs that causes the spot to change color. Results show up in less than a minute and can be easily read using a color scale provided with the device. (The team even chose colors that someone who is color blind can see.)<br/><br/>
      A survey of doctors in the field convinced Sindi to make the technology’s first application a liver function test. All across the developing world, powerful drugs are used to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and hepatitis. These same potent medicines can cause liver damage or failure if not closely monitored. In developed countries, doctors monitor liver function frequently, changing or stopping medication at the first sign of trouble. But in isolated, rural corners of the world, the idea of health monitoring simply doesn’t exist. The tragic result is that millions are dying from the very medications meant to save them—all because they can’t access health monitoring.<br/><br/>
      In many areas, medical care must take place without electricity, clean water, or skilled professionals. Even if someone manages to reach a clinic with doctors, it takes weeks to process lab results. By then, irreversible liver damage has occurred, and many patients who live far away can’t be located again. For Sindi, the solution is to bring the “lab” to them, and paper-based technology allows that to happen. “Paper is very inexpensive, universally available, lightweight, and easy to carry,” she explains. “Health care workers will be able to visit as many as 200 homes each day, perform tests, and take action immediately. Only minimal training is required and no external power, electricity, equipment, clean water, or sterile environment is needed. After use, devices can be burned with a match, preventing contamination. It’s a tool that allows even the poorest people in the most medically challenged places to get the tests they need.”<br/><br/>
      Sindi’s determination to tackle daunting problems should come as no surprise. Despite coming from humble means, never traveling outside Saudi Arabia or speaking a word of English, she moved to England in hopes of attending university there. Alone, homesick, and worried that she would fail and dishonor her family, she learned English by watching BBC news broadcasts and studied up to 20 hours a day for college entrance exams. Against improbable odds, she became the first Saudi woman accepted at Cambridge University in the male-dominated field of biotechnology. She went on to earn her Ph.D., teach in the international medical program, present work to the House of Commons, and become a visiting scholar at Harvard University.<br/><br/>
      “When people tell me things are impossible, it just gives me energy,” she says. Each year the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sponsors the $100K Entrepreneurship Competition. When Sindi decided to enter her business plan for the paper-based diagnostic innovation, she was told it could never win as a nonprofit entity. Advisors urged her to attract investors with a for-profit plan and wait to help the developing world until after garnering big earnings. “I thought, how long will that take, 10 or 15 years? Meanwhile, how many lives will be lost?” She refused to waver from her goal of reaching needy people as fast as possible, and hers became the first nonprofit enterprise ever to win the prestigious international contest. The team also won the Harvard Enterprise Competition—the first group ever to win both prizes in the same year.<br/><br/>
      Sindi’s irrepressible passion and accomplishments have made her a role model for women and girls across the Middle East and the world. “I want all women to believe in themselves and know they can transform society.” She lectures and appears on talk shows and even bicycled across the Middle East with hundreds of professional women to highlight the plight of women and children. “At schools, the first thing I ask children to do is to draw a picture of a scientist [and] 99.9 percent of them draw an old bald man with glasses. When I tell them I’m a scientist they look so surprised.” A new foundation she’s launched gives guidance and seed money to inspire youth who attend university abroad to bring their talent back to their homelands and “flourish to their maximum potential.”<br/><br/>
      “My message is: Find a mission in life and contribute something to humanity. For me, science is a universal language that transcends nationality, religion, and gender. It can help solve any problem our world faces.” To prove it, she’s using a little piece of paper and one very big idea.
