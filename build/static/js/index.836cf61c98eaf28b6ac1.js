Exploring what he calls the âhuman frontierâ, he has continued to press into the most remote and physically engaging parts of the world to take a technologistâs approach to uncover some of humanityâs most charismatic stories and explore the frontiers of the human experience. He began his career with the Valley of the Khans Project, a technology-enabled search for the tomb of Genghis Khan. Tools such as satellite imagery, crowdsourcing engines, machine learning, drones, and ground-penetrating radar permitted Lin to search for archaeological sites through a vast area while respecting traditional beliefs of indigenous people that called for non-invasive investigations.<br/><br/>\n      He has since applied similar approaches to survey the First Emperorâs tomb in China and most recently the Mayan temples of Northern Guatemala. He is responsible for National Geographicâs first crowdsourcing effort to survey satellite imagery in archaeology, which he turned into the platform Tomnod (meaning âbig eyeâ in Mongolian), which has been used by millions on projects ranging from search and rescue to humanitarian and environmental monitoring. Inspired by the idea that science could be democratized through our connectivity, he later co-founded the education company Planet3 Inc. to combine video game design with crowdsourcing to break down the walls of the classroom.\n    ',history:[{year:"GRANT AWARDED 2018",content:"PROMOTING COEXISTENCE WITH LIONS AND REDUCING HUMAN</br>-LION CONFLICT IN NORTHERN KENYA."},{year:"GRANT AWARDED 2016",content:"BUILD A BOMA - SAMBURU AND LAIKIPIA."},{year:"GRANT AWARDED 2014",content:"CARNIVORE CONNECTIONS: MAINTAINING CONNECTIVITY FOR LARGE CARNIVORES ACROSS THE</br>LAIKIPIA-SAMBURU ECOSYSTEM THROUGH COMMUNITY-BASED CONSERVATION."},{year:"GRANT AWARDED 2012",content:"SECURING A FUTURE FOR CHEETAHS THROUGH COMMUNITY-BASED CONSERVATION IN NORTHERN KENYA."},{year:"GRANT AWARDED 2010",content:"CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY OF LIONS IN NORTHERN KENYA: MITIGATING THREATS THROUGH</br>APPLIED RESEARCH AND COMMUNITY-BASED CONSERVATION."},{year:"GRANT AWARDED 2010",content:"CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY OF LIONS IN NORTHERN KENYA: MITIGATING THREATS THROUGH</br>APPLIED RESEARCH AND COMMUNITY-BASED CONSERVATION."}]},{head:"2017 EMERGING EXPLORER",img:"/public/img/images/explorers/DanielleLee.png",name:"DANIELLE N.

According to Hayat Sindi, when this tiny piece of paper enters an impoverished African village, the power of an entire diagnostic lab has arrived.<br/><br/>\n      âMy mission is to find simple, inexpensive ways to monitor health that are specifically designed for remote places and harsh conditions,â Sindi notes. She believes technology pioneered by a team at Harvard University will make it possible, and she co-founded the nonprofit Diagnostics For All to produce and distribute the innovation.<br/><br/>\n      The low-tech diagnostic tool detects disease by analyzing bodily fluids. The device is produced by etching micro-channels and wells onto a small square of paper and pre-filling the wells with chemicals. To perform a test, a drop of saliva, urine, or blood is placed on the paper. The fluid travels through the channels and a chemical reaction occurs that causes the spot to change color. Results show up in less than a minute and can be easily read using a color scale provided with the device. (The team even chose colors that someone who is color blind can see.)<br/><br/>\n      A survey of doctors in the field convinced Sindi to make the technologyâs first application a liver function test. All across the developing world, powerful drugs are used to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and hepatitis. These same potent medicines can cause liver damage or failure if not closely monitored. In developed countries, doctors monitor liver function frequently, changing or stopping medication at the first sign of trouble. But in isolated, rural corners of the world, the idea of health monitoring simply doesnât exist. The tragic result is that millions are dying from the very medications meant to save themâall because they canât access health monitoring.<br/><br/>\n      In many areas, medical care must take place without electricity, clean water, or skilled professionals. Even if someone manages to reach a clinic with doctors, it takes weeks to process lab results. By then, irreversible liver damage has occurred, and many patients who live far away canât be located again. For Sindi, the solution is to bring the âlabâ to them, and paper-based technology allows that to happen. âPaper is very inexpensive, universally available, lightweight, and easy to carry,â she explains. âHealth care workers will be able to visit as many as 200 homes each day, perform tests, and take action immediately. Only minimal training is required and no external power, electricity, equipment, clean water, or sterile environment is needed. After use, devices can be burned with a match, preventing contamination. Itâs a tool that allows even the poorest people in the most medically challenged places to get the tests they need.â<br/><br/>\n      Sindiâs determination to tackle daunting problems should come as no surprise. Despite coming from humble means, never traveling outside Saudi Arabia or speaking a word of English, she moved to England in hopes of attending university there. Alone, homesick, and worried that she would fail and dishonor her family, she learned English by watching BBC news broadcasts and studied up to 20 hours a day for college entrance exams. Against improbable odds, she became the first Saudi woman accepted at Cambridge University in the male-dominated field of biotechnology. She went on to earn her Ph.D., teach in the international medical program, present work to the House of Commons, and become a visiting scholar at Harvard University.<br/><br/>\n      âWhen people tell me things are impossible, it just gives me energy,â she says. Each year the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sponsors the $100K Entrepreneurship Competition. When Sindi decided to enter her business plan for the paper-based diagnostic innovation, she was told it could never win as a nonprofit entity. Advisors urged her to attract investors with a for-profit plan and wait to help the developing world until after garnering big earnings. âI thought, how long will that take, 10 or 15 years? Meanwhile, how many lives will be lost?â She refused to waver from her goal of reaching needy people as fast as possible, and hers became the first nonprofit enterprise ever to win the prestigious international contest. The team also won the Harvard Enterprise Competitionâthe first group ever to win both prizes in the same year.<br/><br/>\n      Sindiâs irrepressible passion and accomplishments have made her a role model for women and girls across the Middle East and the world. âI want all women to believe in themselves and know they can transform society.â She lectures and appears on talk shows and even bicycled across the Middle East with hundreds of professional women to highlight the plight of women and children. âAt schools, the first thing I ask children to do is to draw a picture of a scientist [and] 99.9 percent of them draw an old bald man with glasses. When I tell them Iâm a scientist they look so surprised.â A new foundation sheâs launched gives guidance and seed money to inspire youth who attend university abroad to bring their talent back to their homelands and âflourish to their maximum potential.â<br/><br/>\n      âMy message is: Find a mission in life and contribute something to humanity. For me, science is a universal language that transcends nationality, religion, and gender. It can help solve any problem our world faces.â To prove it, sheâs using a little piece of paper and one very big idea.\n    ",history:[{year:"GRANT AWARDED 2018",content:"PROMOTING COEXISTENCE WITH LIONS AND REDUCING HUMAN</br>-LION CONFLICT IN NORTHERN KENYA."},{year:"GRANT AWARDED 2016",content:"BUILD A BOMA - SAMBURU AND LAIKIPIA."},{year:"GRANT AWARDED 2014",content:"CARNIVORE CONNECTIONS: MAINTAINING CONNECTIVITY FOR LARGE CARNIVORES ACROSS THE</br>LAIKIPIA-SAMBURU ECOSYSTEM THROUGH COMMUNITY-BASED CONSERVATION."},{year:"GRANT AWARDED 2012",content:"SECURING A FUTURE FOR CHEETAHS THROUGH COMMUNITY-BASED CONSERVATION IN NORTHERN KENYA."},{year:"GRANT AWARDED 2010",content:"CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY OF LIONS IN NORTHERN KENYA: MITIGATING THREATS THROUGH</br>APPLIED RESEARCH AND COMMUNITY-BASED CONSERVATION."},{year:"GRANT AWARDED 2010",content:"CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY OF LIONS IN NORTHERN KENYA: MITIGATING THREATS THROUGH</br>APPLIED RESEARCH AND COMMUNITY-BASED CONSERVATION."}]},{head:"2011 EMERGING EXPLORER",img:"/public/img/images/explorers/PaulaKahumbu.png",name:"PAULA KAHUMBU",title:{area:"AREAS OF EXPERTISE",role:"Animal Sanctuaries, Activism, Social Media, Wildlife Conservation"},desc:"\n      Paula Kahumbu received her Ph.D. in Ecology at Princeton University where she studied elephants in coastal Kenya.

Its hull was hemorrhaging diesel fuel and synthetic lubricants that would eventually result in the devastating spill of over 110,000 liters of contaminants into the Pacific ecosystem.

The Heiltsuk Nation has fostered complex and sustainable relationships with their traditional lands and waters for at least a documented 14,000 years, and likely longer. The NES spill site, known locally as Gale Pass (at and around the ancient village of QâvÃºqvai), was and remains a focal and biodiverse community harvesting ground. The impacts of the diesel spill on the Heiltsuk cannot be overstated; not only do the fishing grounds represent an abundance of protein that supports physical subsistence, but also the area provides a powerful environment to practice traditional harvesting, knowledge transmission, and support Heiltsuk cultural revitalization efforts despite more than two centuries of oppressive colonization.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    '},{title:"Top 25: Wild Birds with Spectacular Catches",subTitle:"This week we are allowed a unique insight into the lives of birds that hunt.

Those within parts of the Earth where trees are dominant are termed âintactâ or âprimaryâ forests. A few weeks ago I joined more than a hundred other scientists and conservationists for a three-day conference at Oxford University in England to discuss the issues, needs, similarities, and differences related to the science and conservation of the worldâs forest landscapes that are considered intact.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The conference, Intact Forests in the 21st Century, included presentations on the issues of how best to map and identify intact forest landscapes, methods for inventory and identification of conservation values of intact forests, ways of communicating about the importance of intact forests to the public and policy makers, elucidation of the major threats and stressors that are eliminating or degrading intact forests, and strategies for achieving conservation of these forest landscapes.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Five regions of the globe have very large forested landscapes that contain large tracts of intact or primary forest: the Boreal Forest of Canada and Alaska, the Boreal Forest of Russia and Scandinavia, the Amazon Forest of South America, the Congo Basin of Africa, and the forests of Papua New Guinea and Malayasia. While this âFamily of Fiveâ forest areas are called by some the âLast Five,â it is important to point out that there are other areas of forest around the globe, some of which, while perhaps smaller at the global scale, are intact and others which are recovering from past human impacts and that need conservation attention as well.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          But certainly the âFamily of Fiveâ was a major focus of presentations at the conference and the range of research and conservation initiatives that are underway in these regions is impressive. At the same time, it was clear from all presentations that there continues to be rapid loss of these last intact forest landscapes on the planet, with consequent loss of animal and plant species as well as degradation of the ability of forests to provide clean air and water, and to store away carbon pollution.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The Boreal Forest region of Canada and Alaska was highlighted for its global significance containing as it does, at least a quarter of the worldâs last large intact forest landscapes that have in storage over 200 billion tons of carbon and that support billions of migratory birds and a host of mammals, fish, insects, and plants.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Also highlighted was the fact that the Boreal Forest of Canada and Alaska is the ancestral homeland of hundreds of Indigenous communities whose governments are increasingly taking the lead in achieving balanced protection and stewardship of their lands and waters, and the animals and plants found there.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Some of the major problems in the region were also given attention including the plight of rapidly declining Boreal Woodland Caribou populations in Canada and the opportunity for increasing protections as governments strive to achieve by 2020 the conservation commitments embodied in the Aichi Biodiversity Treaty. The long-term impacts to the Boreal Forest of the very large footprint of industrial forestry as well as from mining, oil, and gas; large-scale hydro, and other global industries was demonstrated as well.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          As the conference reached its conclusion, delegates came together to show a global voice and vision for the worldâs remaining intact forests and their conservation through an Intact Forest Declaration that attendees and others will be signing and spotlighting in coming months.

I attended as part of the delegation of WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) to focus on issues regarding sharks and rays. CITES member governments have been working to secure a future for species threatened by trade since the Convention entered into force in 1975. In the last several years, it has finally been placing an increasing focus on saving the worldâs sharks and rays. CITES member governments meet every 2-3 years to decide which species should be protected under the treatyâeither regulating or prohibiting their trade (so-called âAppendicesâ). With an unstainable, largely unregulated trade in fins (and increasingly shark meat) driving global declines of sharks and rays, in 2013 CITES took a landmark step in protection speciesâsuch as hammerhead sharks and manta raysâthat were being driven to the brink of extinction by the international demand for their fins (and for mantas, their gill plates). Today, the real work is underway, for governments to implement these listings, and ensure that hammerhead sharks, mantas, devil rays, and many other species, do not disappear due to rampant, unsustainable international trade.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          WCS is at the forefront of that effort, both at these high-level scientific meetings at high-level international conferences such as the CITES Conference of the Parties, at the UN level, and on the ground globally, where our programs around the world work closely with Governments to put in place the monitoring, enforcement and management measures that these listings mandate.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Last week in Geneva, the gathered experts discussed new and innovative ways of identifying shark and ray products that are being traded illegallyâusing visual and genetic enforcement tools. They also reviewed progress to date, and reminded countries of the need for domestic action to properly manage shark catch and trade\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Progress is slow, but crucial. For many countries, the CITES listings of sharks and rays provided the first driver to manage trade and the fisheries that underpin them, building on the strong record of enforcement action that the CITES Convention carries.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Tens of millions of sharks and rays are in international trade every year for the food trade, and CITES is trying to do its part to ensure they have a future. Sharks wonât be effectively protected or sustainably managed overnight, but CITES shark and ray listings, and the real change their careful implementation is bringing, provide a ray of hope that we can act before these ancient predators vanish forever.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    '},{title:"CHANGING PLANET",subTitle:"Invasion of the Death Stars: Surveying COTS & Coral Health With the Trident ROV",markup:'\n      <img src="/public/img/images/exBlog/ex02.jpg" alt="ex02" />\n      <div class="desc">\n        <p class="person">By David McGuire</p>\n        <p>\n          The water is 30 degrees C.

Last year a COTS increase was observed on the reef at the Park, an area of high human habitation and impact. Some of the most effective predators on the starfish include titan triggerfish (Balistoides viridescens), and the Maori wrasse (Cheilinus undulates) and Triton snails (Charonia tritonis).

Today, National Geographic is launching Planet or Plastic?, a multiyear initiative aimed at raising awareness of this challenge and reducing the amount of single-use plastic that enters in the worldâs oceans. Doing so will not only benefit the thousands to potentially millions of marine animals that become entangled in, suffocated by, or ingest plastic each year, but will also contribute to the overall health of the planetâs marine ecosystems and all who rely upon them.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          As a global brand with a rich history of scientific discovery and exploration, National Geographic is uniquely positioned to tackle this crisis in a way that only National Geographic can â through storytelling and science. The Planet or Plastic? initiative will leverage the power of National Geographicâs media portfolio around the world and the expertise of National Geographicâs explorers and scientists who are witnessing firsthand the devastating impacts of this crisis. This organization-wide effort will include a major research and scientific initiative; a consumer education and engagement campaign; updated internal corporate sustainability commitments; and innovative partnerships with like-minded corporations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from all over the world.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Todayâs launch is tied to the release of the June issue of National Geographic magazine, which takes an in-depth look at the role single-use plastic plays in our society and the impact they are having on our environment. Starting with this issue, National Geographic announced that it will begin wrapping the U.S., U.K. and India subscriber editions of the magazine in paper instead of plastic, with the goal of wrapping all global editions in paper by the end of 2019.
